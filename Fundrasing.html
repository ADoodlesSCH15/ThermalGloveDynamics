<h2> Fundraising </h2>
<p> To get started with our innovation, funding we will need enough to be able to buy all of our materials to make the gloves as well as create the heating and cooling system. It will cost roughly £10-£15 pounds to create a pair of gloves as it takes time to make and you buy materials in bulk, that's why our price will be £25 so we can order new materials and make profit for improvements. To help raise money for our innovation we can hold quizzes, bingos, beetle drives, and other community events around the west of the isle of man. Each event will cost £2 per adult and £2 per child, it will cost this price as that is quite a decent amount for going to an event where you win prizes. We can also have stalls at local markets where people can test and try out our gloves. </p>
