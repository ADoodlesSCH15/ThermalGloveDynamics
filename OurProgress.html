<h2> Our Progress </h2>
<p>The validations of our innovation is that it helps the needs of people with Raynaud syndrome and palmer hyperhidrosis by making the temperature the correct amount of degrees for the comfort of your hands. This involves the understanding of how some have troubles with their hands' temperature throughout the year. The technology with our thermal gloves is the science with the temperature changes of the gloves. The processes to change the temperature would include insulation to help slow down the temperature changes so it's not really hot to very cold in an instant. This addresses a customer's real needs as it can be difficult to do things when your hands are at some drastic temperature. This also meets the expectations a customer may have for our innovation with it being like a normal glove but it changes the temperature based on what temperature. We are going to be presenting this to people by using popular social media apps to show them the qualities of our product/ innovation.</p>
<br>
<p>The progress in developing the innovation we all have shared out the questions to answer them and each have created something as Aimee L has made the website, Aimee R has made the Powerpoint, Rubyann has made the video (which is located on the Powerpoint) and Aimee R and Rubyann are making the 3d model of our design . In more depth the video explains the pain of trying to find gloves that keep your hands at a nice temperature and you can use your phone with, until someone shows them the new thermal gloves which change the temperature. While the Powerpoint has all the information you need to know about thermal gloves. The website states facts to make people who read it interested in our innovation, this will eventually be where we will sell our product from.</p>
