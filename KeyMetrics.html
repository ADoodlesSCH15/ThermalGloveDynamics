<h2> Our Key Metrics </h2>
<p> Our innovation: Whilst on the outside they seem like simple gloves, ThermaGloves host intricately designed layers of pure comfort and thermal delight. The outside will be a weatherproof durable layer with grip on the fingers so you can continue to do things such as use your phone. The inner layers consist of a sodium acetate solution encased in a soft malleable plastic. This is what changes based on temperature. The final layer is a soft cotton layer that is a breathable soft fabric for the ultimate comfort. With a comfortable velcro wrist strap they fit hands/wrists of any size. They will come in many different colour combinations so we can satisfy all of our audience.</p>
<br>
<p>Our gloves are different from others due to the technologically advanced layers of interchangeable incalescence. This eliminates discomfort in the hands throughout different seasons. We want to protect our company by Patenting our thermal gloves. We would also make sure we have copyright over stuff such as videos and photos. To trademark our business name, we'll search for existing names, choose your goods/services classes, and then file an application with the relevant intellectual property office detailing your brand and paying fees, a process that takes several months for examination and potential approval.</p> 
<br>
<p>Our gloves can change lives for individuals with both palmar hyperhidrosis and Raynaud's.  As someone that's lived in the UK I know how cold it can be. I also know how brutal heatwaves can be and how frustrating it can be to sweat, especially in the hands. Our gloves can be the difference to someone leaving the house and making memories with their family. Both Raynaud's and hyperhidrosis also affect children from doing things such as playing sports,riding bikes, and going outdoors. These gloves could be the difference to making a happier society. </p>
