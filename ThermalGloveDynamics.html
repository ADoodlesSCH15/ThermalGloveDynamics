<h2>Our Idea</h2>

 <p> Our idea is to create gloves that change based on the atmosphere. we took our ideas from stuff like reuseable handwarmers and reuseable ice pacts </p>

<p>Gloves traditionally only work in one climate.
Whilst winter gloves are good in the cold, they aren’t very practical doing something as simple as using your phone becomes really difficult.</p>
 
<h2>Our Innovation</h2>
 
<p>We wanted to combine handwarmers withs icepacks , in a comfortable and functional way. So we figured, Why not make gloves with the ability to warm up like handwarmers and cooldown like icepacks. Thermal gloves are a creative glove design which was innovated to produce gloves which can change the temperature to adapt to your hands temperature, this happens by the click of a button. Our gloves are for everyone but our main target audience is the people who have Raynaud's syndrome where their fingers go numb in the response to the cold that they turn white, and people with palmer hyperhidrosis whose hands sweat really easily under stress. This is aimed at them because normal gloves won’t cool down or heat up their desperate hands, so we made thermal gloves. The gloves work with any activity you may do at any time in the year. If successful we could turn this into a business to be able to then help others around the world all year round.</p> </body> </html>
